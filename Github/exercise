1)A terminal to me is a command tool to directly control a computer.

2.) Git is a version control that lets developers track changes to their code, and GitHub is a web-based hosting for repositories.

3.) First, go to your repository, and in the top right corner, click fork next choose an owner for the forked repository, then choose a name for the repository(this is optional), you can add a description and or do so a 'copy the default branch only.' then just create the fork.
